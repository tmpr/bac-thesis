We also focused on the significance of some implementations embedded in algorithm of each tool. Based on 10 simulated trees of different number of taxa generated by R, 400 known alignments and sequence files were constructed using indel-Seq-Gen. A total of 4000 test alignments were generated to study the effect of sequence length, indel size, deletion rate, and insertion rate. Results showed that alignment quality was highly dependent on the number of deletions and insertions in the sequences and that the sequence length and indel size had a weaker effect. Overall, {ProbCons} was consistently on the top of list of the evaluated {MSA} tools. {SATe}, being little less accurate, was 529.10\% faster than {ProbCons} and 236.72\% faster than {MAFFT}(L-{INS}-i). Among other tools, Kalign and {MUSCLE} achieved the highest sum of pairs.

	abstract = {Motivation
Pair Hidden Markov Models ({PHMMs}) are probabilistic models used for pairwise sequence alignment, a quintessential problem in bioinformatics. {PHMMs} include three types of hidden states: match, insertion and deletion. Most previous studies have used one or two hidden states for each {PHMM} state type. However, few studies have examined the number of states suitable for representing sequence data or improving alignment accuracy.

Results
We developed a novel method to select superior models (including the number of hidden states) for {PHMM}. Our method selects models with the highest posterior probability using Factorized Information Criterion, which is widely utilized in model selection for probabilistic models with hidden variables. Our simulations indicated that this method has excellent model selection capabilities with slightly improved alignment accuracy. We applied our method to {DNA} datasets from 5 and 28 species, ultimately selecting more complex models than those used in previous studies.

This global alignment algorithm is the best approach for identifying similar regions between sequences. This study presents a new application of classical machine learning ({ML}) to global sequence alignment. Customized {ML} models are used to implement {NW} global alignment. An accuracy of 99.7\% is achieved when using a multilayer perceptron with the {ADAM} optimizer, and up to 2912 Giga cell updates per second are realized on two real {DNA} sequences with a length of 4.1 M nucleotides.

The information from sequence alignments potentially available using an optimal scoring system is compared with that obtained using the {BLASTN} default scoring. A modified {BLAST} database search tool allows these, or other explicitly specified scoring matrices, to be utilized in computationally efficient queries of nucleic acid databases with nucleic acid query sequences.

	abstract = {Multiple comparison or alignmentof protein sequences has become a fundamental tool in many different domains in modern molecular biology, from evolutionary studies to prediction of 2D/3D structure, molecular function and inter-molecular interactions etc. By placing the sequence in the framework of the overall family, multiple alignments can be used to identify conserved features and to highlight differences or specificities. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive evaluation of many of the most popular methods for multiple sequence alignment ({MSA}), based on a new benchmark test set. The benchmark is designed to represent typical problems encountered when aligning the large protein sequence sets that result from today's high throughput biotechnologies. We show that alignmentmethods have significantly progressed and can now identify most of the shared sequence features that determine the broad molecular function(s) of a protein family, even for divergent sequences. However,we have identified a number of important challenges. First, the locally conserved regions, that reflect functional specificities or that modulate a protein's function in a given cellular context,are less well aligned. Second, motifs in natively disordered regions are often misaligned. Third, the badly predicted or fragmentary protein sequences, which make up a large proportion of today's databases, lead to a significant number of alignment errors. Based on this study, we demonstrate that the existing {MSA} methods can be exploited in combination to improve alignment accuracy, although novel approaches will still be needed to fully explore the most difficult regions. We then propose knowledge-enabled, dynamic solutions that will hopefully pave the way to enhanced alignment construction and exploitation in future evolutionary systems biology studies.},

In this paper we discuss the current state of protein structures known for the human and other proteomes and how Alphafold2 might impact on variant interpretation efforts. For the human proteome in particular, the state of the available structural data suggests that the impact on variant interpretation might be less than anticipated.

Different similarity scoring matrices are most effective at different evolutionary distances. “Deep” scoring matrices like {BLOSUM}62 and {BLOSUM}50 target alignments with 20 – 30\% identity, while “shallow” scoring matrices (e.g. {VTML}10 – {VTML}80), target alignments that share 90 – 50\% identity, reflecting much less evolutionary change. While “deep” matrices provide very sensitive similarity searches, they also require longer sequence alignments and can sometimes produce alignment overextension into non-homologous regions. Shallower scoring matrices are more effective when searching for short protein domains, or when the goal is to limit the scope of the search to sequences that are likely to be orthologous between recently diverged organisms. Likewise, in {DNA} searches, the match and mismatch parameters set evolutionary look-back times and domain boundaries. In this unit, we will discuss the theoretical foundations that drive practical choices of protein and {DNA} similarity scoring matrices and gap penalties. Deep scoring matrices ({BLOSUM}62 and {BLOSUM}50) should be used for sensitive searches with full-length protein sequences, but short domains or restricted evolutionary look-back require shallower scoring matrices.},

For 11 proteomes, an average of 25\% additional residues can be confidently modeled when compared with homology modeling, identifying structural features rarely seen in the Protein Data Bank. {AF}2-based predictions of protein disorder and complexes surpass dedicated tools, and {AF}2 models can be used across diverse applications equally well compared with experimentally determined structures, when the confidence metrics are critically considered.

The astounding success even led to claims that the protein folding problem is “solved”. However, protein folding problem is more than just structure prediction from sequence. Presently, it is unknown if the {AlphaFold}-triggered revolution could help to solve other problems related to protein folding. Here we assay the ability of {AlphaFold} to predict the impact of single mutations on protein stability (ΔΔG) and function. To study the question we extracted metrics from {AlphaFold} predictions before and after single mutation in a protein and correlated the predicted change with the experimentally known ΔΔG values. Additionally, we correlated the {AlphaFold} predictions on the impact of a single mutation on structure with a large scale dataset of single mutations in {GFP} with the experimentally assayed levels of fluorescence. We found a very weak or no correlation between {AlphaFold} output metrics and change of protein stability or fluorescence. Our results imply that {AlphaFold} cannot be immediately applied to other problems or applications in protein folding.},

Here, we systematically test the performance of existing alignment algorithms on structural {RNAs}. This work was aimed at achieving the following goals: (i) to determine conditions where it is appropriate to apply common sequence alignment methods to the structural {RNA} alignment problem. This indicates where and when researchers should consider augmenting the alignment process with auxiliary information, such as secondary structure and (ii) to determine which sequence alignment algorithms perform well under the broadest range of conditions. We find that sequence alignment alone, using the current algorithms, is generally inappropriate {\textless}50-60\% sequence identity.

When the automated system was applied successively to all 437 groups of related proteins in the {PROSITE} catalog, 1764 blocks resulted; these could be used for very sensitive searches of sequence databases. Each block was calibrated by searching the {SWISS}-{PROT} database to obtain a measure of the chance distribution of matches, and the calibrated blocks were concatenated into a database that could itself be searched. Examples are provided in which distant relationships are detected either using a set of blocks to search a sequence database or using sequences to search the database of blocks. The practical use of the blocks database is demonstrated by detecting previously unknown relationships between oxidoreductases and by evaluating a proposed relationship between {HIV} Vif protein and thiol proteases.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, {AlphaFold}, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ({CASP}14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of {AlphaFold} is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Background
The performance of alignment programs is traditionally tested on sets of protein sequences, of which a reference alignment is known. Conclusions drawn from such protein benchmarks do not necessarily hold for the {RNA} alignment problem, as was demonstrated in the first {RNA} alignment benchmark published so far. For example, the twilight zone – the similarity range where alignment quality drops drastically – starts at 60 \% for {RNAs} in comparison to 20 \% for proteins. In this study we enhance the previous benchmark.

Results
The {RNA} sequence sets in the benchmark database are taken from an increased number of {RNA} families to avoid unintended impact by using only a few families. The size of sets varies from 2 to 15 sequences to assess the influence of the number of sequences on program performance. Alignment quality is scored by two measures: one takes into account only nucleotide matches, the other measures structural conservation. The performance order of parameters – like nucleotide substitution matrices and gap-costs – as well as of programs is rated by rank tests.

Conclusion
Most sequence alignment programs perform equally well on {RNA} sequence sets with high sequence identity, that is with an average pairwise sequence identity ({APSI}) above 75 \%. Parameters for gap-open and gap-extension have a large influence on alignment quality lower than {APSI} ≤ 75 \%; optimal parameter combinations are shown for several programs. The use of different 4 × 4 substitution matrices improved program performance only in some cases. The performance of iterative programs drastically increases with increasing sequence numbers and/or decreasing sequence identity, which makes them clearly superior to programs using a purely non-iterative, progressive approach. The best sequence alignment programs produce alignments of high quality down to {APSI} {\textgreater} 55 \%; at lower {APSI} the use of sequence+structure alignment programs is recommended.},

	abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment is one of the cornerstones of modern molecular biology. It is used to identify conserved motifs, to determine protein domains, in 2D/3D structure prediction by homology and in evolutionary studies. Recently, high-throughput technologies such as genome sequencing and structural proteomics have lead to an explosion in the amount of sequence and structure information available. In response, several new multiple alignment methods have been developed that improve both the efficiency and the quality of protein alignments. Consequently, the benchmarks used to evaluate and compare these methods must also evolve. We present here the latest release of the most widely used multiple alignment benchmark, {BAliBASE}, which provides high quality, manually refined, reference alignments based on 3D structural superpositions. Version 3.0 of {BAliBASE} includes new, more challenging test cases, representing the real problems encountered when aligning large sets of complex sequences. Using a novel, semiautomatic update protocol, the number of protein families in the benchmark has been increased and representative test cases are now available that cover most of the protein fold space. The total number of proteins in {BAliBASE} has also been significantly increased from 1444 to 6255 sequences. In addition, full-length sequences are now provided for all test cases, which represent difficult cases for both global and local alignment programs.

	abstract = {{BRaliBase} is a widely used benchmark for assessing the accuracy of {RNA} secondary structure alignment methods. In most case studies based on the {BRaliBase} benchmark, one can observe a puzzling drop in accuracy in the 40–60\% sequence identity range, the so-called ‘{BRaliBase} Dent’. In this article, we show this dent is owing to a bias in the composition of the {BRaliBase} benchmark, namely the inclusion of a disproportionate number of transfer {RNAs}, which exhibit a conserved secondary structure. Our analysis, aside of its interest regarding the specific case of the {BRaliBase} benchmark, also raises important questions regarding the design and use of benchmarks in computational biology.},

	abstract = {By using two models of evolutionary base substitutions--"three-substitution-type" and "two-frequency-class" models--some formulae are derived which permit a simple estimation of the evolutionary distances (and also the evolutionary rates when the divergence times are known) through comparative studies of {DNA} (and {RNA}) sequences. These formulae are applied to estimate the base substitution rates at the first, second, and third positions of codons in genes for presomatotropins, preproinsulins, and alpha- and beta-globins (using comparisons involving mammals). Also, formulae for estimating the synonymous component (at the third codon position) and the standard errors are obtained. It is pointed out that the rates of synonymous base substitutions not only are very high but also are roughly equal to each other between genes even when amino acid-altering substitution rates are quite different and that this is consistent with the neutral mutation-random drift hypothesis of molecular evolution.},
